# Ca-spike-extraction-and-SVM-decoder

This code combines the spike extraction ML spike algorithm (http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12190) and trains the SVM decoder
based on the extracted spikes. It is the mutual work of me and Reza Eghbali. The training data came from the Brain Observatory in the Allen Institute (http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding/) during the dynamic brain course (http://courses.washington.edu/braindyn/).

Best,
Anatoly
