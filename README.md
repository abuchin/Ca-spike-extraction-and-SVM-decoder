# Ca-spike-extraction-and-SVM-decoder

This code combines the spike extraction ML spike algorithm (http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12190) and trains the SVM decoder
based on the extracted spikes. The trained data comes from the Brain Observatory in the Allen Institute 
(http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding/).
