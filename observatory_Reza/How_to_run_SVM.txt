Algorithm to run SVM on another spike input

   
1) Pool spiking data:

   firing_rate.py
   fr = np.zeros... - pools the firing-rates from loaded all_spikes_binary_file.csv
   

2) Run SVM on spikes (compares shuffled vs. non-shuffled)
   
   read_data.py
   # load firing rates, read dsi
   fr - is the vector of poold firing-rates from all_spikes_binary_file.csv


3) Add return to save the data from 

	decoder.py
	def svm_decoder
	...
	return - something, original_vector,  shuffled_vector
